# PasswordListGenerator
This project is build on the idea of CUPP and Mentalist to generate password list using different combinations of name, Birthdate, and special characters, mirroring the ideas of a human to minimize the number of passwords to be bruteforced or rather trying a random wordlist like rockyou that has millions of random passwords, it creates unique wordlist for everyone reducing time and increasing possibility to crack.
